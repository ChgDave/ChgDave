🌱 Hello! My name is Hailong Zhou and I go by David. I have recently started full-stack coding bootcamp at Northwestern University. This is my github page where I will be adding on all my coding projects. I love climibing 🧗‍♀️ and I love solving puzzles 🧩. Writing code is just like solving puzzles for me. Figuring out each piece of code to complete an entire application brings me tremendous joy and the sense of achievement in the end is extremely rewarding. I am looking forward to collaborate with industry experts on future projects to learn more about coding and explore the limitless potential in technology. If you have any ideas, thoughts or feedback, feel free to submit an issue or reach out to me.🌱
