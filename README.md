🌱 Hello! My name is Hailong Zhou and I go by David. I have recently started full-stack coding bootcamp at Northwestern University. This is my github page where I will be adding on all my coding projects. I am looking forward to collaborate with industry experts on future projects to learn more about coding and explore the limitless potential in technology. If you have any ideas, thoughts or feedback, feel free to submit an issue or reach out to me.🌱
